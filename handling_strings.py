print('Hello, \tmy name is \"Mark\" \n and I am off work today')

'''Hereâ€™s what each part means:

"Hello, my name is": Regular text.
\t: A tab space. The backslash (\) tells Python to interpret the next character (t) as a tab instead of the letter "t."
"Mark": The name "Mark" appears between double quotes (\"Mark\") due to the escape sequence \". The backslash before the quote allows the double quotes to appear in the output. \ means treate n as a new line'''
