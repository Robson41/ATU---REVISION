'''Write a Python program that:
Asks the user for the name of a text file.
Attempts to open the file in read mode.
If the file exists, it prints the contents to the screen.
If the file doesnâ€™t exist, it shows an error message (use try/except).
Bonus: After printing the content, also print the number of lines in the file.'''
